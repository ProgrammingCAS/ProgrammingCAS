In this CAS experience I will be learning python and C, I will start by making simple programs and eventually progress to harder topics. 
By the end I will have a fully write my retrospect on the exeprience. My log books can be found in the project repository. 

If you arent familiar with GitHub please find me in school or email at [jakkuc0321@skola.goteborg.se]

Thanks, Jakov
